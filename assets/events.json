Check our <a id=\"CP___PAGEID=810834,calendar.htm,4679|\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/dena\/planyourvisit\/calendar.htm\">calendar of events<\/a> to determine how many daily offerings there are at a given point in the summer. Fewer programs are offered in May and September. <br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>American Sign Language<\/h3>\n<p>Our goal is to provide American Sign Language interpretation, when requested, for all ranger programs. Denali is very remote, however, so please <a id=\"\/common\/utilities\/sendmail\/sendemail.cfm?o=4F80D5BA91DA90B59ABD1C8FF707B8E3419250&amp;r=\/dena\/planyourvisit\/sled-dog-demonstrations.htm|\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/common\/utilities\/sendmail\/sendemail.cfm?o=4F80D5BA91DA90B59ABD1C8FF707B8E3419250&amp;r=\/dena\/planyourvisit\/sled-dog-demonstrations.htm\">request ASL interpretation<\/a> as early as you can to ensure that we can accommodate your request!<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Visiting the Kennels<\/h3>\n<p><br \/>You don't have to limit your visit to a time when we offer a formal demonstration. The kennels are open to visitors year-round, generally from <strong>9 am—4:30 pm <\/strong>(though hours may vary outside of summer). Safety bulletins are posted at the kennels entrance - please read through these before walking into the kennels. Also, <strong>please do not bring pets into the kennels<\/strong>.<br \/><br \/>In summer (roughly mid-May through mid-September), you can easily reach the Headquarters and sled dog kennels via the <a id=\"CP___PAGEID=928226,courtesy-shuttle-buses.htm,4679|\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/dena\/planyourvisit\/courtesy-shuttle-buses.htm\">free sled dog demonstration bus<\/a>. Public parking in this area is limited—if you drive yourself to the kennels, do not expect to find a parking spot.<br \/><br \/>In winter (roughly mid-September through mid-May), the kennels focus on preparing for long patrol trips in the park. You may get to see teams packing or harnessing to leave on a run, teams returning from a run, or you may find very few dogs in the kennel as the rest are out on a run.<\/p>","images":[{"path":"\/common\/uploads\/event_calendar\/E8D71661-C8C8-420A-1862E9020EF27A30.jpg","credit":"NPS Photo","imageid":"19673","altText":"a park ranger riding a cart pulled by dogs on a track","title":"","ordinal":"0","caption":"A ranger demonstrates the energy and enthusiasm of the park sled dogs","url":"\/common\/uploads\/event_calendar\/E8D71661-C8C8-420A-1862E9020EF27A30.jpg"}],"category":"Regular Event","imageidlist":"","isregresrequired":"false","organizationname":"","id":"96244AB9-B237-2324-2A89FD9C4846C405","isallday":"false","dateend":"2019-05-30","sitecode":"dena","infourl":"","times":[{"timestart":"02:00 PM","timeend":"03:00 PM","sunsetend":"false","sunrisestart":"false"}],"regresinfo":"","timeinfo":"Note: There is no parking at the kennels.
